        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This are the steps you need to follow to make Chapati a very delicious Kenyan dish that can be paired with stew, tea or curry.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups of all purpose sieved flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of Margarine (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</li>
                <li>1/2 Teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 Cups warm water</li>
                <li>Oil for cooking</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, mix flour, sugar and salt. Add Margarine, mix with hands to form crumbs. I use a little bit of sugar in mine because I love the savoury taste. Omit it, if you don't like sugar.</li>
                <li>Make a well and pour water bit by bit as you knead. Knead for atleast 5 mins, if the dough is sticky, add flour bit by bit as you knead.</li>
                <li>Continue kneading on your work surface for another 3 mins. (FOR SOFT CHAPATIS, YOU SHOULD KNEAD THOROUGHLY)</li>
                <li>Finally dough should be firm but soft and not sticky. Cover with a damp cloth/ cling film/plastic polythene bag for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 30mins, knead again and cut into balls.</li>
                <li>Roll out the balls in a circular shape with a rolling pin, one at a time and brush with oil, as shown in the pics.</li>
                <li>In a medium heat, place your skillet, let it warm up. Then put your chapati ontop. Fry both sides until brown. Once cooked remove and place it in a containee and cover.
                </li>
                <li>Serve with your favourite stew or even tea. Enjoy.</li>
